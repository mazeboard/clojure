Every sub-element of the tree provided will generate an anonymous\n   normalizing component if that element has an ID field. For to-many relations only the first item is used for query/ident\n   generation.\n\n   The returned anonymous component will have initial state that matches the provided entity data tree.\n\n   This means you can use a sample tree to generate both the initial state for a subtree of your app and the components\n   necessary to do I/O on that tree.\n\n   This kind of component will *not* be registered in the component registry unless you pass a :componentName\n   via the top-level-options. A registry entry is necessary for things that\n   require the registry, such as dynamic queries and UI state machines).\n   \"\n  ([entity-data-tree]\n   (entity->component entity-data-tree {}))\n  ([entity-data-tree top-level-options]\n   (let [{:keys [joins initial-state attrs]} (reduce-kv\n                                               (fn [result k v]\n                                                 (cond\n                                                   (and (vector? v) (every? map? v))\n                                                   (let [c (entity->component (first v))]\n                                                     (-> result\n                                                       (update :initial-state assoc k v)\n                                                       (update :joins assoc k (query c))))\n                                                   (map? v) (let [c (entity->component v)]\n                                                              (-> result\n                                                                (update :initial-state assoc k v)\n                                                                (update :joins assoc k (query c))))\n                                                   :else (-> result\n                                                           (update :initial-state assoc k v)\n                                                           (update :attrs conj k))))\n                                               {:attrs         #{}\n                                                :initial-state {}\n                                                :joins         {}}\n                                               entity-data-tree)\n         query (into (vec attrs)\n                 (map (fn build-subquery* [[join-key subquery]] {join-key subquery}))\n                 joins)]\n     (nc query (merge\n                 {:initial-state (fn [& args] initial-state)}\n                 top-level-options)))))\n\n(letfn [(get-subquery-component*\n          [c ast-nodes query-path]\n          (if (empty? ast-nodes)\n            c\n            (let [k  (first query-path)\n                  ks (rest query-path)\n                  {:keys [component children] :as node} (first (filter #(= k (:key %)) ast-nodes))]\n              (if (seq ks)\n                (recur component children ks)\n                component))))]\n\n  (defn get-subquery-component\n    \"Obtains the normalizing component that is associated with the given query path on the given component.\n\n    For example `(get-subquery-component Person [:person/addresses])` would return the component for\n    the `:person/addresses` join.
